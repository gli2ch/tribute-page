# Freecodecamp Project
This a tribute page about Alan Turing I designed for my first project of responsive web designe course at freecodecamp.org <br />
you can check out the project here  https://gli2ch.github.io/tribute-page/ <br />
The page isn't complete yet as I haven't added any media queries so the page isn't responsive, I'm still working on that as I don't understand media queries completly yet. <br />
